    My guide was Lalita and she was very friendly and helpful. We lost each other in the crowds for a moment but she looked after me and gave me all history of the Taj Mahal and the family. We enjoyed a little street food after and she drew henna on me as I mentioned I'd always wanted. Very nice lady and lucky to have her as my guide. Also perfect for help with being solo traveller getting photos of myself to show family. Thank you :)

          With its shapely fenders and sprawling rear wing, the Huayra looks like it was built to conquer the racetrack. And much like a race car, it's constructed with an eye on minimizing curb weight. It's made from materials such as carbon-titanium HP62, a substance that's lighter and stronger than standard carbon fiber. The current Huayra is scheduled to be the last of the line. Still, that may change, since Pagani has a history of acquiescing to the requests of private collectors seeking a one-off or limited-edition model. With only 40 production models planned, the Huayra is rare and magnificent.

        Since the first Phantom appeared in 1925, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has had its ups and downs. When the outgoing Phantom appeared at the stroke of midnight on January 1st 2003, the company even called it ‘the last great automotive adventure’.
        Maybe that should have been penultimate, because we’ve just driven the new car, and as internal combustion most likely won’t be around in another 14 years’ time, this really could be The One.       
        Rolls-Royce reckons the Phantom is the barometer by which everyone else in the world of expensive luxury goods measures themselves, so the bar isn’t just raised here, it’s bejewelled and platinum-plated. You know when someone claims to be ‘the Rolls-Royce of watches/furniture/granite-kitchen-worktops’? Well, this is the Rolls-Royce of Rolls-Royces.       
        Rolls says the Phantom's new spaceframe structure is 30 per cent more rigid than the previous model, a figure that rises significantly in key areas such as suspension and gearbox. This new structure, coincidentally, offers sufficient flexibility to underpin the next wave of Rolls product, its SUV included.

            Jaguar I Pace: What’s it like on the outside?
            In a word, radical. Jaguar’s designers have made the most of the design flexibility an EV allows (there’s no bulky engine or gearbox to work around) and it shows in the way the I-Pace looks. Sure, the ‘raised eyebrow’ headlights and square grille are familiar Jaguar, but the stubby bonnet, cab-forward design and large passenger cell are a big departure from the traditional SUV silhouette. Even the rake of the rear windscreen is a break from the norm. Whether the look works for you comes down to personal taste, though the attention the 4.6m long I-Pace drew over a day’s driving was quite revealing. The Jag looks futuristic and really stands out.   </p>
